## About

This website shares lecture content from a course currently taught at the University of Neuchatel on how generative AI tools — large language models, coding agents, retrieval-augmented generation — are transforming research workflows in economics and the social sciences. The material follows the complete research cycle, from reading papers and reviewing literature to brainstorming hypotheses, analyzing data, writing, and presenting — exploring both traditional methods and GenAI tools at every stage.

The goal is not just to *use* these tools, but to use them **responsibly and rigorously**, understanding their strengths, limitations, and the risks they introduce to scientific work.

## What You'll Find Here

::: {.outcomes-list}
- Critical comparisons of traditional research methods with AI-assisted approaches
- Practical guidance on using generative AI tools responsibly at each stage of the research process
- An honest evaluation of the strengths, biases, and risks of AI tools applied to research
