## About

This course explores how generative AI tools — large language models, coding agents, retrieval-augmented generation — are transforming research workflows: literature review, hypothesis generation, data analysis, scientific writing, and reproducibility. Each session pairs traditional research methods with their AI-augmented counterparts, maintaining causal rigor and scientific standards throughout.
